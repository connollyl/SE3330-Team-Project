//Change the controllers constructors to public: 
	//1.so that they can be accessed via the form classes

//Reject duplicate names for menu items
	//1.to give the buttons meaningful names

/------------------------------------------------------------/
Not required if we use the controller properly
Need to add category to MenuItem 
	1.to bind the buttons to the appropriate containers
	2.to hide the buttons along with their groupbox
/-----------------------------------------------------------/

Need to actually add functionality to the Admin controller
	1.duh

Need to add Admin controller as a member of OrderController
	1.vice versa(maybe?)
	2.so the two can interact within the policy layer

*Might need persistent count of the menuItems for OrderController*
	1.for its list... so it knows how many to grab from AdminController

Why does AdminController.addMenuItem return a pointer to the list instead of a pointer to the item?

Need a function in the controller or the UI that returns a Point()
	1.so all the buttons can be placed on the form correctly

When declaring a list as a dataMember it needs to be default initialized
---------------------------------------------------------------------------Sunday

Order Controller needs a persistent list of menuitems

Order Controller needs a persistent list of categories (?)
